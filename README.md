# Global and Regional Game Sales Analysis (1980s-2020)

In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of global and regional game sales from the 1980s to 2020 using time-series data. The goal was to identify trends and patterns across different markets, platforms, genres, and publishers. The analysis was conducted using advanced data visualization techniques in Power BI.


## Key Responsibilities:

- Sales Breakdown: Conducted a detailed breakdown of game sales by regions (North America, Europe, Japan, and Other regions) as well as global sales totals. The analysis helped to pinpoint key markets for video game sales.

- Top Platforms: Identified the platforms with the highest overall sales, comparing regional contributions to those platform sales. This highlighted how platform success varies between markets.

- Yearly Trends: Tracked yearly sales trends to determine whether older or newer games performed better across different regions. This provided insights into how regional preferences and global trends have evolved over decades.

- Genre Popularity: Analyzed the popularity of different game genres both globally and by region. This helped to understand how consumer preferences differ by market.

- Publisher Performance: Evaluated publisher performance in various regions, determining which publishers dominated sales in specific markets and globally over the given period.


## Tools & Techniques:

Power BI: Created interactive dashboards and visualizations to track how sales by regions, genres, platforms, and publishers evolved over time. The dashboards provided clear insights into shifting market dynamics and helped to uncover emerging trends in the video game industry.
